# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals

-	The goal of this project was to analyze user behavior and sales data, identifying key insights such as top-performing cities, marketing channels, and product categories. We also aimed to clean and validate the data for reliable reporting and decision-making.

## Process
-	Step 1: Perform QA checks to identify risks such as missing values, unnormalized revenue, duplicates, and inconsistent transaction records.

-	Step 2: Clean the dataset by replacing placeholder values in city and country, and handling NULLs in key numeric and text fields.

-	Step 3: Conduct SQL-based analysis to answer questions about top-selling products, marketing channel performance, and average user behavior by region.

## Results

-  	The United States generated the most revenue, particularly from cities like San Francisco and Sunnyvale.
-	Direct traffic brought in the most revenue overall, with Referral and Organic Search showing influence in specific countries.

-	Visitors mostly bought branded merchandise, such as Google and YouTube apparel.

-	Users who spent more time on the site or visited more pages tended to show stronger engagement.

## Challenges 
	
-	Many key columns had NULL values, requiring careful handling to avoid misleading results.

-	Revenue values were stored in micros, which needed normalization to reflect real-world currency.

-	Placeholder values and duplicate IDs required extra processing during QA.


## Future Goals
**If more time were available, I would:**

-	Build visual dashboards using tools like Tableau or Power BI for dynamic exploration.

-	Segment visitors by behavior (e.g., new vs. returning) to analyze retention and conversion.
	
-	Perform time-based analysis to see how user behavior changes over weeks or marketing campaigns.
  
-	Incorporate external data, such as demographics or seasonal trends, for deeper insights.
